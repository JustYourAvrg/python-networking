# A Repo of my progression through networking with python


# Started on 2/25/2024


# echo-server | 2/25/2024 | First Project
I mean, it was basically the first thing to learn in socket programming... not sure if It can be made better 
well all it does is get a message from the client and... echos it back lol


# Multi-conn-chat | 2/28/2024 | Second Project
Extremely simple and pretty bad as of 2/28/2024
I'm still fairly new to socket programming and have never used the threading library in python
I will probably make it better when I've gained more knowledge in socket programming and threading


# web-servers | 3/2/2024 | Third Project
Starting here I wanted to switch from socket to asyncio, even though asyncio is alot harder to learn then socket
I felt it would be better for the type of projects I want to do. 
the web-servers folder will be a list of web server related projects
